# LoadingScreenPlugin
A plugin for Unity that handles the logic of showing/updating a game's loading screen so you can focus on designing and expanding it.
For design ideas, check out the [loading screen database](https://loucacoles.notion.site/Loading-Screen-Database-2b0bc522c6634f23987ba287fcf4960d) that I have been working on.
